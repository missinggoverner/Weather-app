​I developed a simple weather application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to retrieve and display current weather information for a specified location.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in integrating third-party APIs and manipulating the DOM to create interactive web applications.
Features:

Location-Based Weather Data: Users can input a city or region to fetch real-time weather details.​
Dynamic UI Updates: The interface dynamically updates to reflect the retrieved weather information without requiring a page reload.​
Responsive Design: The application is styled with CSS to ensure usability across various devices and screen sizes.​
